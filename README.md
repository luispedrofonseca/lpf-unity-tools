lpf-unity-tools
===============

A bunch of random scripts that I've gathered over the years to speed up Unity projects development. Several of these are not mine or have been adapted from other sources. Credits are in place where applicable.

Add the following to your dependencies on your packages `manifest.json` file:
"com.luispedrofonseca.lpf-unity-tools": "https://github.com/luispedrofonseca/lpf-unity-tools.git"
